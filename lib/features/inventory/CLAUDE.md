# CLAUDE.md — inventory

Rules specific to the item list, the item forms and what a seller can do to an
item. The root `CLAUDE.md` still applies in full; this file only holds what
would be wrong to generalise.

## Every action on an item is reachable from the row

Owner's rule. `ItemActionsSheet` opens from two places and they offer the same
list: the detail screen's Actions button, and **the `more_vert` button on
`ItemCard`**.

- **The row is the point.** Listing, repricing and marking sold are what a
  seller does while looking at the list. Reaching them only through detail
  cost a push and a pop per item — on a forty-row afternoon, eighty taps that
  buy nothing.
- **One sheet, not two lists of verbs.** Both entry points call
  `ItemActionsSheet.show`, so an action added there cannot go missing from the
  row.
- **`more_vert`, not the detail screen's `tune`** — owner's rule. A glyph is
  all the width allows beside a title, two badges and a price line, so it has
  to be one a seller already knows; `tune` reads as filtering when it is not
  sitting next to the word Actions. The detail screen keeps `tune` because it
  has room for the label.
- **It disappears while a bulk selection is open.** Every tap ticks a row
  then, and a sheet for one item would lose the forty the seller had just
  picked — the same reason a tap selects instead of navigating in that mode.
- **`onActions` is nullable**, so a list that only navigates simply does not
  pass it.
- `test/features/inventory/item_card_actions_test.dart` holds all four.

## The actions that would be refused are shown, not hidden

A move the item cannot make yet still appears in the sheet, and tapping it
says which field is missing (`ItemBlockPresenter`). Hiding "List" from an item
with no price teaches nothing; "Add an asking price to list this" teaches the
rule and points at the fix.

## The item form seeds through `FormSeed`

The record arrives on a stream, so the form learns it exists inside a `build` —
and writing the form's controller from there throws. See
`docs/rules/SCREENS.md`, which carries the rule and the reason.
